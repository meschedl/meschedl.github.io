Today I went birding for the first "real" time in 2019, meaning that I submitted an eBird [checklist](https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S53901464). Which is actually my first checklist for Rhode Island, besides the incidental [recording](https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S53789614) of an American Woodcock in my backyard! Perks of living on a lake. I haven't been birding a lot since I've moved and I really want to change that. Partly it's because it was winter and birds were few and I can't handle the cold, but partly it is because it's hard to bird here because my knowlege of New England birds is so minimal. I've realized how important it is for me to learn calls; I barely recognized any today! And I should be excited about learning other than California instead of being intimidated.

When I joined my undergraduate lab in 2018, I can't say I had really been birding before. And I had really been missing out. I don't necessarily think it's about just the birds; there is also so much patience and appreciation of nature that comes with birding. And I already considered myself a very patient person, which I think is partly why I took to birding so well. I honestly don't mind standing for a while staring at a bush and making "ssshhhshshshh" noises.
