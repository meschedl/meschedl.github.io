### Current Projects



**I am taking 2 graduate classes this semester! Check out their GitHub repos:**

[Using Genomic Techniques to Examine the Evolution of Populations]https://github.com/jpuritz/BIO_594_2019)

[Evolutionary and Ecological Genomics](https://github.com/pradac/BIO594_2019)

[Putnam Open Lab Notebook](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/)
Open for Science, My goal is to facilitate scientific advancement through the open sharing of data and analytical approaches. As with science, this notebook is a work in process, hopefully advancing with every iteration.

[Narraganset Bay eDNA Project](https://github.com/meschedl/Narragansett_Bay_eDNA)
GitHub repo for a beginning project for long term eDNA monitoring of Narraganset Bay

**Check out the awesome stuff that my undergraduate lab does!**

The Moore Laboratory of Zoology at Occidental College. Their Instagram is particularly amazing, and I'm not just saying that because I took some of the pictures on there :)
