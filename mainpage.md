### Current Projects



**I am taking 2 graduate classes this semester! Check out their GitHub repos:**

Using Genomic Techniques to Examine the Evolution of Populations [HERE](https://github.com/jpuritz/BIO_594_2019)

Evolutionary and Ecological Genomics [HERE](https://github.com/pradac/BIO594_2019)

**Putnam Open Lab Notebook**
Open for Science, My goal is to facilitate scientific advancement through the open sharing of data and analytical approaches. As with science, this notebook is a work in process, hopefully advancing with every iteration. [HERE](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/)

**Narraganset Bay eDNA Project**
GitHub repo for a beginning project for long term eDNA monitoring of Narraganset Bay [HERE](https://github.com/meschedl/Narragansett_Bay_eDNA)
